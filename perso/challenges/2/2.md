# chapter 2: a map of the territory - challenge

## 1. pick an open source implementation of a language

download and poke around it. try to find the code thqt implements the scanner
and parser. are they handwritten or generated using tolls like Lexx and Yacc
(.l and .y files)

Go: https://github.com/golang/go

- scanner: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/go/scanner/scanner.go
- parser: https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/go/parser/parser.go

## 2. what are the reasons NOT to use JIT (just in time compilation)?

not doing JIT == doing AoT (ahead of time)

- when wanting to be 'close to the metal'; not relying on a framework/runtime
  that lives on the end-user machine
- when requiring fast startup; cold startup are common in Cloud native apps
- requires extra resource on host machine

## 3. Lisp compiling to C while interpreting too

most Lisp implementation that compile to C also contain an interpreter that
lets them execute Lisp code on the fly as well. Why?

> Most Lisp implementations that compile to C include an interpreter to enable interactive development and debugging of Lisp code, provide portability, and offer a fallback option for running Lisp programs on platforms without a compiler.
> [...]
> It allows programmers to quickly test and experiment with their code without the need to compile it each time.
