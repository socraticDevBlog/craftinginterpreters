## 2. get a "hello world" programm running in java

### install java runtime on macos
```
brew install java

For the system Java wrappers to find this JDK, symlink it with
  sudo ln -sfn /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk

openjdk is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because macOS provides similar software and installing this software in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have openjdk first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find openjdk you may need to set:
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/include"
```

### code itself
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

```
### compile and execute
````
touch HelloWorld.java # copy/paste code itself in this file

javac HelloWorld.java

java HelloWorld
````

## hello world in C

### code itself

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}

```

```
gcc hello.c -o hello

./hello
```

### double linked list with functions

asked chatGPT to set me up and read the code to figure out how it was
implemented
